Each answer lists two types of devices used in a 100BASE-T network. If these devices were connected with UTP Ethernet cables, which pairs of devices would require a straight-through cable? (Choose three answers.)

A PC and switch 
B Hub and switch 
C Router and hub 
D Wireless access point (Ethernet port) and switch 
E PC and router

Explanation: Answers A, C, and D are correct.

Routers, wireless access point Ethernet ports, and PC NICs all send using pins 1 and 2, whereas hubs and LAN switches transmit on pins 3 and 6. Straight-through cables connect devices that use opposite pin pairs for sending, because the cable does not need to cross the pairs.

Which of the following are true about the format of Ethernet addresses? (Choose three answers.)
A Each manufacturer puts a unique OUI code into the first 3 bytes of the address. 
B Each manufacturer puts a unique OUI code into the first half of the address. 
C The part of the address that holds this manufacturer's code is called the MAC. 
D The part of the address that holds this manufacturer's code is called the OUI. 
E The part of the address that holds this manufacturer's code has no specific name. 
F Each manufacturer puts a unique OUI code into the first 2 bytes of the address.

Explanation: Answers A, B, and D are correct.

The pre-assigned universal MAC address, given to each Ethernet port when manufactured, breaks the address into two 3-byte halves. The first half is called the organizationally unique identifier (OUI), which the IEEE assigns to the company that builds the product as a unique hex number to be used only by that company.

The process of TCP on one computer marking a TCP segment as segment 1, and the receiving computer then acknowledging the receipt of TCP segment 1 is an example of what?
A Adjacent-layer interaction 
B OSI model 
C All of these answers are correct. 
D Data encapsulation 
E Same-layer interaction

Explanation: Answer E is correct.

Same-layer interaction occurs on multiple computers. The functions defined by that layer typically need to be accomplished by multiple computers - for example, the sender setting a sequence number for a segment, and the receiver acknowledging receipt of that segment. A single layer defines that process, but the implementation of that layer on multiple devices is required to accomplish the function.

Which of the following terms is used specifically to identify the entity created when encapsulating data inside data link layer headers and trailers?
A Segment 
B Chunk 
C Data 
D Packet 
E Frame

Explanation: Answer E is correct.

By convention, the term frame refers to the part of a network message that includes the data link header and trailer, with encapsulated data. The term packet omits the data link header and trailer, leaving the network layer header with its encapsulated data. The term segment omits the network layer header, leaving the transport layer header and its encapsulated data.

Which OSI layer defines the functions of logical network-wide addressing and routing?
A Layer 5, 6, or 7 
B Layer 4 
C Layer 3 
D Layer 2 
E Layer 1

Explanation: Answer C is correct.

The network layer concerns itself with delivery of data over the complete end-to-end path. That requires a way to identify each device, using addresses, and the addresses must be logical addresses that are therefore not tied to the physical details of the network.

In the LAN for a small office, some user devices connect to the LAN using a cable, while others connect using wireless technology (and no cable). Which of the following is true regarding the use of Ethernet in this LAN?
A Only the devices that use wireless are using Ethernet. 
B Only the devices that use cables are using Ethernet. 
C None of the devices are using Ethernet. 
D Both the devices using cables and those using wireless are using Ethernet.

Explanation: Answer B is correct.

The IEEE defines Ethernet LAN standards, with standard names that begin with 802.3, all of which happen to use cabling. The IEEE also defines wireless LAN standards, with standard names that begin with 802.11, which are separate standards from Ethernet.

Which of the following is true about the CSMA/CD algorithm?

A The algorithm never allows collisions to occur. 
B Collisions can happen, but the algorithm defines how the computers should notice a collision and how to recover. 
C The algorithm works with only two devices on the same Ethernet. 
D None of the other answers is correct.

Explanation: Answer B is correct.

NICs (and switch ports) use the carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) algorithm to implement half-duplex logic. CSMA/CD attempts to avoid collisions, but it also notices when collisions do occur, with rules about how the Ethernet nodes should stop sending, wait, and try again later.

Which of the following Ethernet standards defines Gigabit Ethernet over UTP cabling?

A None of the other answers is correct. 
B 1000BASE-T 
C 100BASE-T 
D 10GBASE-T 

Explanation: Answer B is correct.

The number before the word BASE defines the speed, in megabits per second (Mbps). 1000 Mbps equals 1 gigabit per second (1 Gbps). The T in the suffix implies twisted-pair or UTP cabling, so 1000BASE-T is the UTP-based Gigabit Ethernet standard name.

Which of the following was a short-term solution to the IPv4 address exhaustion problem?
A IP version 6 
B IP version 5 
C NAT/PAT 
D ARP

Explanation: Answer C is correct.

NAT, specifically the PAT feature that allows many hosts to use private IPv4 addresses while being supported by a single public IPv4 address, was one short-term solution to the IPv4 address exhaustion problem. IP version 5 existed briefly as an experimental protocol and had nothing to do with IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 directly addresses the IPv4 address exhaustion problem, but it is a long-term solution. ARP has no impact on the number of IPv4 addresses used.

PC1 and PC2 are on two different Ethernet LANs that are separated by an IP router. PC1's IP address is 10.1.1.1, and no subnetting is used. Which of the following addresses could be used for PC2? (Choose two answers.)

A 10.200.200.1 
B 9.1.1.1 
C 225.1.1.1 
D 1.1.1.1 
E 10.1.1.2 
F 10.2.2.2

Explanation: Answers B and D are correct.

Without any subnetting in use, all addresses in the same network as 10.1.1.1 - all addresses in Class A network 10.0.0.0 - must be on the same LAN. Addresses separated from that network by some router cannot be in network 10.0.0.0. So, the two correct answers are the only two answers that list a valid unicast IP address that is not in network 10.0.0.0.

A router receives an Ethernet frame that holds an IPv6 packet. The router then makes a decision to route the packet out a serial link. Which of the following statements is true about how a router forwards an IPv6 packet?

A The router keeps the Ethernet header, encapsulating the entire frame inside a new IPv6 packet before sending it over the serial link. 
B The router makes the forwarding decision based on the packet's source IPv6 address. 
C The router discards the Ethernet data-link header and trailer of the received frame. 
D The router uses the IPv4 routing table when choosing where to forward the packet.

Explanation: Answer C is correct.

Routers use the same process steps when routing IPv6 packets as they do when routing IPv4 packets. Routers route IPv6 packets based on the IPv6 addresses, listed inside the IPv6 header in the IPv6 packets, by comparing the destination IPv6 address to the router's IPv6 routing table. As a result, the router discards the incoming frame's data-link header and trailer, leaving an IPv6 packet. The router compares the destination (not source) IPv6 address in the header to the router's IPv6 (not IPv4) routing table and then forwards the packet based on the matched route.

A company implements a TCP/IP network, with PC1 sitting on an Ethernet LAN. Which of the following protocols and features requires PC1 to learn information from some other server device?
A None of these answers is correct. 
B ARP 
C ping 
D DNS

Explanation: Answer D is correct.

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) does allow PC1 to learn information, but the information is not stored on a server. The ping command does let the user at PC1 learn whether packets can flow in the network, but it again does not use a server. With the Domain Name System (DNS), PC1 acts as a DNS client, relying on a DNS server to respond with information about the IP addresses that match a given hostname.

Which of the following are true about a LAN-connected TCP/IP host and its IP routing (forwarding) choices? (Choose two answers.)

A The host always sends packets to its default gateway. 
B The host sends packets to its default gateway if the destination IP address is in a different class of IP network than the host. 
C The host sends packets to its default gateway if the destination IP address is in a different subnet than the host. 
D The host sends packets to its default gateway if the destination IP address is in the same subnet as the host.

Explanation: Answers B and C are correct.

IPv4 hosts generally use basic two-branch logic. To send an IP packet to another host on the same IP network or subnet that is on the same LAN, the sender sends the IP packet directly to that host. Otherwise, the sender sends the packet to its default router (also called the default gateway).

A Cisco Catalyst switch has 24 10/100 ports, numbered 0/1 through 0/24. Ten PCs connect to the ten lowest numbered port, with those PCs working and sending data over the network. The other ports are not connected to any device. Which of the following answers lists facts displayed by the show interfaces status command?

A Port Ethernet 0/15 is in a not connected state. 
B Port Ethernet 0/1 is in a connected state. 
C Port Fast Ethernet 0/11 is in a connected state. 
D Port Fast Ethernet 0/5 is in a connected state.

Explanation: Answer D is correct.

The show interfaces status command lists one line of output per interface. Cisco Catalyst switches name the type of interface based on the fastest speed of the interface, so 10/100 interfaces would be Fast Ethernet. With a working connection, ports from FastEthernet 0/1 through 0/10 would be listed in a connected state, while the rest would be listed in a not connected state.

D Switch serial interface

Explanation: Answer B is correct.

The four-wire circuit cable supplied by the telco connects to the device acting as the CSU/DSU. That can be an external CSU/DSU or a CSU/DSU integrated into a router serial interface card. LAN switches do not have serial interfaces, and router serial interfaces do not have transceivers.

In a two-tier campus LAN design, which of the following are typically true of the topology design? (Choose two answers.)

A The design uses a partial mesh of links between access and distribution switches 
B The design uses a full mesh of links between access and distribution switches 
C The end user and server devices connect directly to access layer switches 
D The design uses a partial mesh of links between the distribution and core switches

Explanation: Answers A and C are correct.

The access layer switches play the role of connecting to the endpoint devices, whether they are end-user devices or servers. Then, from the access to the distribution layer, each access layer connects to two distribution switches typically, but with no direct connections between access layer switches, creating a mesh, but a partial mesh. A two-tier design, also called a collapsed core, does not use core switches at all.

Which of the following commands identify switch interfaces as being trunking interfaces: interfaces that currently operate as VLAN trunks? (Choose two answers.)

A show trunks 
B show interfaces 
C show interfaces switchport 
D show interfaces trunk 

Explanation: Answers C and D are correct.

The show interfaces switchport command lists both the administrative and operational status of each port. When a switch considers a port to be trunking, this command lists an operational trunking state of "trunk." The show interfaces trunk command lists a set of interfaces: the interfaces that are currently operating as trunks. So, both these commands identify interfaces that are operational trunks.

Which one answer gives the strongest match between one part of a typical three-tier design with the idea behind the listed generic topology design term?

A The access layer looks like a partial mesh. 
B The access layer looks like a star design. 
C The distribution layer looks like a hybrid design. 
D The distribution layer looks like a full mesh. 

Explanation: Answer B is correct.

The access layer uses access switches, which connect to endpoint devices. A single access switch with its endpoint devices looks like a star topology. The distribution layer creates a partial mesh of links between the distribution switches and access switches, so it is neither a full mesh nor a hybrid.

Two routers, R1 and R2, connect using an Ethernet over MPLS service. The service provides point-to-point service between these two routers only, as a Layer 2 Ethernet service. Which of the following are the most likely to be true about this WAN? (Choose two answers.)

A R1 will forward data-link frames to R2 using an Ethernet header/trailer. 
B R1 will connect to a physical Ethernet link, with the other end of the cable connected to R2 
C R1 will connect to a physical Ethernet link, with the other end of the cable connected to a device at the WAN service provider point of presence. 
D R1 will forward data-link frames to R2 using an HDLC header/trailer. 

Explanation: Answers A and C are correct.

The physical installation uses a model in which each router uses a physical Ethernet link to connect to some SP device in an SP facility called a point of presence (PoP). The Ethernet link does not span from each customer device to the other. From a data-link perspective, both routers use the same Ethernet standard header and trailer used on LANs; HDLC does not matter on these Ethernet WAN links.

Switch SW1 sends a frame to switch SW2 using 802.1Q trunking. Which of the answers describes how SW1 changes or adds to the Ethernet frame before forwarding the frame to SW2?

A None of the other answers are correct. 
B Encapsulates the original frame behind an entirely-new Ethernet header 
C Inserts a 4-byte header and does not change the MAC addresses 
D Inserts a 4-byte header and does change the MAC addresses 

Explanation: Answer C is correct.

802.1Q defines a 4-byte header, inserted after the original frame's destination and source MAC address fields. The insertion of this header does not change the original frame's source or destination address. The header itself holds a 12-bit VLAN ID field, which identifies the VLAN associated with the frame.

C PC5, which is separated from PC1 by a router 
D PC2, which is separated from PC1 by an Ethernet hub 

Explanation: Answers A, B, and D are correct.

A Class B network needs to be subnetted such that it supports 100 subnets and 100 hosts/subnet. Which of the following answers list a workable combination for the number of network, subnet, and host bits? (Choose two answers.)
A Network = 8, subnet = 7, host = 17
B Network = 16, subnet = 7, host = 7
C Network = 16, subnet = 8, host = 8
D Network = 16, subnet = 9, host = 7

Explanation: Answers C and D are correct.

At least 7 subnet bits are needed, because 26 = 64, so 6 subnet bits could not number 100 different subnets. Seven subnet bits could, because 27 = 128 => 100. Similarly, 6 host bits is not enough, because 26 − 2 = 62, but 7 host bits is enough, because 27 − 2 = 126 => 100.

The number of network, subnet, and host bits must total 32 bits, making one of the answers incorrect. The answer with 8 network bits cannot be correct because the question states that a Class B network is used, so the number of network bits must always be 16. The two correct answers have 16 network bits (required because the question states the use of a Class B network), and at least 7 subnet and host bits each.

Switch SW1 uses its Gigabit 0/1 interface to connect to switch SW2's Gigabit 0/2 interface. SW2's Gi0/2 interface is configured with the speed 1000 and duplex full commands. SW1 uses all defaults for interface configuration commands on its Gi0/1 interface. Which of the following are true about the link after it comes up? (Choose two answers.)

A The link runs at 1 Gbps, but SW1 uses half-duplex and SW2 uses full duplex.
B Both switches use full duplex.
C The link works at 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps).
D SW1 attempts to run at 10 Mbps because SW2 has effectively disabled IEEE standard autonegotiation.

Explanation: Answers B and C are correct.

SW2 has effectively disabled IEEE standard autonegotiation by configuring both speed and duplex. However, Cisco switches can detect the speed used by the other device, even with autonegotiation turned off. Also, at 1 Gbps, the IEEE autonegotiation standard says to use full duplex. If the duplex setting cannot be negotiated, so both ends use 1 Gbps, full duplex.

B 224.1.1.255
C 172.30.255.255
D 10.1.255.255

Explanation: Answer C is correct.

To find the network broadcast address, first determine the class, and then determine the number of host octets. At that point, convert the host octets to 255 to create the network broadcast address. In this case, 10.1.255.255 is in a Class A network, with the last three octets as host octets, for a network broadcast address of 10.255.255.255. For 192.168.255.1, it is a Class C address, with the last octet as the host part, for a network broadcast address of 192.168.255.255. Address 224.1.1.255 is a class D address, so it is not in any unicast IP network, so the question does not apply. For 172.30.255.255, it is a Class B address, with the last two octets as host octets, so the network broadcast address is 172.30.255.255.

D SW2 must use the switchport mode trunk configuration command on G0/2, or the link will not use trunking.

Explanation: Answer A is correct.

The show interface switchport command lists a switch's configured value of the switchport mode command as the administrative mode, telling us that SW1 uses the switchport mode trunk configuration command. The operation state shows the current working state (trunk). Of the four answers, one incorrect answer claims that SW2's operational state must also be "trunk"; however, one switch can use trunking, while the other does not. Another answer claims that the administrative mode must be "trunk," which basically means that the command switchport mode trunk must be used. However, SW2 has a few other configuration options that would work, like the switchport mode dynamic desirable and switchport mode dynamic auto commands, with the correct answer referring to one of those commands (the switchport mode dynamic auto command).

Which of the following statements is true about classless IP addressing concepts?

A Uses a 128-bit IP address
B Applies only for Class A and B networks
C Separates IP addresses into network, subnet, and host parts
D Ignores Class A, B, and C network rules

Explanation: Answer D is correct.

Classless addressing rules define a two-part IP address structure: the prefix and the host part. This logic ignores Class A, B, and C rules, and can be applied to the 32-bit IPv4 addresses from any address class. By ignoring Class A, B, and C rules, classless addressing ignores any distinction as to the network part of an IPv4 address.

Which of the following is the resident subnet for IP address 192.168.44.97/30?

A 192.168.44.128
B 192.168.44.96
C 192.168.44.64
D 192.168.44.0

Explanation: Answer B is correct.

First, the resident subnet (the subnet ID of the subnet in which the address resides) must be numerically smaller than the IP address, which rules out one of the answers. The mask converts to 255.255.255.252. As such, you can copy the first three octets of the IP address because of their value of 255. For the fourth octet, the subnet ID value must be a multiple of 4, because 256 − 252 (mask) = 4. Those multiples include 96 and 100, and the right choice is the multiple closest to the IP address value in that octet (97) without going over. So, the correct subnet ID is 192.168.44.96.

A Layer 3 switch has been configured to route IP packets between VLANs 1, 2, and 3, which connect to subnets 172.20.1.0/25, 172.20.2.0/25, and 172.20.3.0/25, respectively. The engineer issues a show ip route command on the Layer 3 switch, listing the connected routes. Which of the following answers lists a piece of information that should be in at least one of the routes?

A Interface Gigabit Ethernet 0/0.3
B Next-hop router 172.20.4.1
C Interface VLAN 2
D Mask 255.255.255.0

Explanation: Answer C is correct.

The configuration of the Layer 3 switch's routing feature uses VLAN interfaces, with the interface number matching the VLAN ID. The matching connected routes, like all connected IP routes, will list the interfaces but not a next-hop IP address. The three connected routes will list the VLAN interfaces 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

When thinking about an IP address using classful addressing rules, an address can have three parts: network, subnet, and host. If you examined all the addresses in one subnet, in binary, which of the following answers correctly states which of the three parts of the addresses will be equal among all addresses? (Choose the best answer.)

A Network and subnet parts
B Host part only
C Subnet part only
D Network part only
E Subnet and host parts


Explanation: Answer A is correct.

When using classful IP addressing concepts as described in Chapter 14, "Analyzing Subnet Masks," addresses have three parts: network, subnet, and host. For addresses in a single classful network, the network parts must be identical for the numbers to be in the same network. For addresses in the same subnet, both the network and subnet parts must have identical values. The host part differs when comparing different addresses in the same subnet.

Working at the help desk, you receive a call and learn a user's PC IP address and mask (192.168.9.1/27). When thinking about this using classful logic, you determine the number of network (N), subnet (S), and host (H) bits. Which of the following is true in this case?

A H=8
B H=7
C N=24
D S=24

Explanation: Answer C is correct.

The size of the network part is always either 8, 16, or 24 bits, based on whether it is Class A, B, or C, respectively. As a Class C address, N=24. The number of subnet bits is the difference between the prefix length (27) and N, so S=3 in this case. The size of the host part is a number that, when added to the prefix length (27), gives you 32, so H=5 in this case.

A PC user opens a command prompt and uses the ipconfig command to see that the PC's IP address and mask are 192.168.4.77 and 255.255.255.224. The user then runs a test using the ping 192.168.4.117 command. Which of the following answers is the most likely to happen?

A The PC sends packets to its default gateway.
B The PC sends packets directly to the host with address 192.168.4.117.
C The PC sends an ARP looking for the MAC address of the DHCP server.
D The PC sends a DNS query for 192.168.4.117.

Explanation: Answer A is correct.

PCs use two-option logic: send local packets (destined for hosts in the same subnet) directly, and send remote packets (destined for hosts in other subnets) to the default gateway/router. In this case, the PC's own IP address is 192.168.4.77, with mask 255.255.255.224, so it is in subnet 192.168.4.64/27. This subnet has a range of addresses from 192.168.4.64 to 192.168.4.95, including the subnet and broadcast address. As a result, the PC sends the packet to its default gateway. As for the other incorrect answers, if the ping command had used a hostname, it would have first asked a DNS server to resolve the name. Also, the PC already has an IP address, so DHCP would not be needed.

Which of the following answers lists the dotted-decimal notation (DDN) equivalent of /30?

A 255.255.255.0
B 255.255.254.0
C 255.255.255.240
D 255.255.255.252
E 255.255.255.192

Explanation: Answer D is correct.

/30 is the equivalent of the mask that in binary has 30 binary 1s. To convert that to DDN format, write down all the binary 1s (30 in this case), followed by binary 0s for the remainder of the 32-bit mask. Then take 8 bits at a time, and convert from binary to decimal (or memorize the nine possible DDN mask octet values and their binary equivalents). Using the /30 mask in this question, the binary mask is 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111100. Each of the first three octets is all binary 1s, so each converts to 255. The last octet, 11111100, converts to 252, for a DDN mask of 255.255.255.252. See Appendix A for a decimal/binary conversion table.

A packet is sent to a destination address. That single packet is replicated by a few routers based on the routers’ knowledge of hosts that had earlier registered to receive packets sent to that destination address. The routers do not forward copies of the packet onto subnets where no hosts have registered, and do forward copies of the packet onto subnets where at least one host has registered to receive those packets. Which of the following IP address types was used as the destination IP address?

A A multicast address
B A subnet broadcast address
C A network broadcast address
D A unicast address

Explanation: Answer A is correct.

By definition, a multicast IP packet (a packet sent to a Class D IP multicast address) is copied as necessary by routers to make extra copies, and forwarded to multiple routers as needed, but not all. The logic revolves around prior knowledge of a host registration process by which hosts declare their interest in receiving packets sent to a particular multicast IP address. Routers exchange this information, so that when a new multicast packet arrives, the routers know where to send copies of that particular multicast packet, and where to not bother to send the packet (because no hosts in that part of the network registered to receive a copy).

A unicast packet would not be forwarded as a data link broadcast at the last step.

A network broadcast would be replicated by different routers as needed so that it was delivered to all subnets in the classful network.

A subnet broadcast would be router as a single packet to the final router in the path. That router would then forward the IP packet as a LAN broadcast so that all hosts in that subnet would receive a copy.

R1 has configured interface Fa0/0 with the ip address 10.5.48.1 255.255.240.0 command. Which of the following subnets, when configured on another interface on R1, would not be considered an overlapping subnet?

A 10.5.0.0 255.255.240.0
B 10.4.0.0 255.254.0.0
C 10.5.32.0 255.255.224.0
D 10.5.0.0 255.255.128.0

Explanation: Answer A is correct.

Subnet 10.5.0.0 255.255.240.0 implies range 10.5.0.0-10.5.15.255, which does not overlap. 10.4.0.0 255.254.0.0 implies range 10.4.0.0-10.5.255.255, which does overlap. 10.5.32.0 255.255.224.0 implies range 10.5.32.0-10.5.63.255, which does overlap. 10.5.0.0 255.255.128.0 implies range 10.5.0.0-10.5.127.255, which does overlap.

An IP subnetting design requires 200 subnets and 120 hosts/subnet for the largest subnets, and requires that a single mask be used throughout the one private IP network that will be used. The design also requires planning for 20 percent growth in the number of subnets and number of hosts/subnet in the largest subnet. Which of the following answers lists a private IP network and mask that, if chosen, would meet the requirements?

A 192.168.7.0/24
B 10.0.0.0/25
C 10.0.0.0/22
D 172.16.0.0/23

Explanation: Answer C is correct.

With a growth of 20 percent, the design needs to support 240 subnets. To meet that need, 7 subnet bits do not meet the need (27 = 128), but 8 subnet bits do meet the need (28 = 256). Similarly, the minimum number of host bits is also 8, because the need, after the 20 percent growth, would be 144 hosts/subnet. That number requires 8 host bits (28 - 2 = 254). These numbers are minimum numbers of subnet and host bits.

The right answer, 10.0.0.0/22, has 8 network bits because the network class is Class A, 14 subnet bits (/22 - 8 = 14), and 10 host bits (32 - 22 = 10). This mask supplies at least 8 subnet bits and at least 8 host bits. The masks in the other answers either do not supply at least 8 host bits or do not supply at least 8 subnet bits.

An engineer has planned to use Class B network 172.19.0.0 and a single subnet mask throughout the network. The answers list the masks considered by the engineer. Choose the mask that, among the answers, supplies the largest number of hosts per subnet, while also supplying enough subnet bits to support 1000 subnets.

A 255.255.252.0
B /28
C 255.255.255.0
D /26

Explanation: Answer D is correct.

To support 1000 subnets, 10 subnet bits (210 = 1024) are needed. The design uses a Class B network, which means that 16 network bits exist as well. So, the shortest mask that meets the requirements is 255.255.255.192, or /26, comprised of 16 network plus 10 subnet bits. The /28 answer also supplies enough subnets to meet the need, but compared to /26, /28 supplies fewer host bits and so fewer hosts/subnet.

B 192.168.9.58
C 192.168.9.144
D 192.168.9.9

Explanation: Answer C is correct.

The first (numerically lowest) subnet ID is the same number as the classful network number, or 192.168.9.0. The remaining subnet IDs are each 8 larger than the previous subnet ID, in sequence, or 192.168.9.8, 192.168.9.16, 192.168.9.24, 192.168.9.32, and so on, through 192.168.9.248.

An engineer has calculated the list of subnet IDs, in consecutive order, for network 172.30.0.0, assuming that the /22 mask is used throughout the network. Which of the following are true? (Choose two answers.)

A Any two consecutive subnet IDs differ by a value of 22 in the third octet.
B Any two consecutive subnet IDs differ by a value of 16 in the fourth octet.
C The list contains 64 subnet IDs.
D The last subnet ID is 172.30.252.0.

Explanation: Answers C and D are correct.

The mask converts to 255.255.252.0, so the difference from subnet ID to subnet ID (called the magic number in this chapter) is 256 - 252 = 4. So, the subnet IDs start with 172.30.0.0, then 172.30.4.0, then 172.30.8.0, and so on, adding 4 to the third octet. The mask, used with a Class B network, implies 6 subnet bits, for 64 total subnet IDs. The last of these, 172.30.252.0, can be recognized in part because the third octet, where the subnet bits sit, has the same value as the mask in that third octet.

R4 has a connected route for 172.16.8.0/22. Which of the following answers lists a subnet that overlaps with this subnet?

A 172.16.6.0/23
B 172.16.16.0/20
C 172.16.11.0/25
D 172.16.0.0/21

Explanation: Answer C is correct.

The four answers imply the following ranges: 172.16.0.0/21: 172.16.0.0-172.16.7.255. 172.16.6.0/23: 172.16.6.0-172.16.7.255. 172.16.16.0/20: 172.16.16.0-172.16.31.255. 172.16.11.0/25: 172.16.11.0-172.16.11.127. The subnet in the question, 172.16.8.0/22, implies a range of 172.16.8.0-172.16.11.255, which includes the range of numbers in subnet 172.16.11.0/25.

A design already includes subnets 192.168.1.0/26, 192.168.1.128/30, and 192.168.1.160/29. Which of the following subnets is the numerically lowest subnet ID that could be added to the design, if you wanted to add a subnet that uses a /28 mask?

A 192.168.1.64/28
B 192.168.1.112/28
C 192.168.1.144/28
D 192.168.1.96/28
E 192.168.1.80/28

Explanation: Answer A is correct.

The question lists three existing subnets, which together consume part of Class C network 192.168.1.0. Just listing the last octet values, these subnets consume 0-63, 128-131, and 160-167. The new subnet, with a /28 mask, needs 16 consecutive numbers, and the subnet numbers will all be a multiple of 16 in the last octet (0, 16, 32, and so on). Looking at the consumed numbers again, the first opening starts at 64 and runs up through 127, so it has more than enough space for 16 addresses. So the numerically lowest subnet number is 192.168.1.64/28, with range 192.168.1.64 - 192.168.1.79.

Which of the following is not a valid subnet ID for network 172.19.0.0, using mask /24, assuming that mask /24 is used throughout the network?

A 172.19.255.0
B 172.19.1.0
C 172.19.0.0
D 172.19.0.16

Explanation: Answer D is correct.

Using mask /24 (255.255.255.0), the subnet IDs increment by 1 in the third octet. The reasoning is that with a Class B network, 16 network bits exist, and with mask /24, the next 8 bits are subnet bits, so the entire third octet contains subnet bits. All the subnet IDs will have a 0 as the last octet, because the entire fourth octet consists of host bits. Note that 172.19.0.0 (the zero subnet) and 172.19.255.0 (the broadcast subnet) might look odd, but are valid subnet IDs.

An engineer is considering configuring an ACL on router R1. The engineer could use ACL A which would be enabled with the ip access-group A out command on interface G0/1, or ACL B, which would be enabled with the ip access-group B in command on that same interface. R1’s G0/1 interface uses IPv4 address 1.1.1.1. Which of the answers is true when comparing these options? (Choose two answers.)

A ACL B creates more risk of filtering important overhead traffic than ACL A.
B A ping 1.1.1.1 command on R1 would bypass ACL A even if enabled.
C A ping 1.1.1.1 command on R1 would bypass ACL B even if enabled.
D ACL A creates more risk of filtering important overhead traffic than ACL B.

Explanation: Answers A and B are correct.

A router bypasses the ACL logic for its own outbound ACLs for packets created by that router. Routers do not make any kind of exception for inbound packets. As a result, ACL B creates more risk than ACL A, because B is enabled as an inbound ACL.

The ping 1.1.1.1 command in two answers is a self-ping of a router’s Ethernet interface. As a result, the router would bypass any outbound ACL logic on that interface, but consider any inbound ACL logic. So router R1 would bypass the logic of ACL A, which would be enabled as an outbound ACL on R1’s G0/1 interface.

Which of the following describes a way to disable IEEE standard autonegotiation on a 10/100 port on a Cisco switch?
A Configure the negotiate disable interface subcommand
B Configure the no negotiate interface subcommand
C Configure the speed 100 interface subcommand
D Configure the duplex half interface subcommand
E Configure the duplex full interface subcommand
F Configure the speed 100 and duplex full interface subcommands

Explanation: Answer F is correct.

Cisco switches do not have a command to disable autonegotiation of speed and duplex. Instead, a switch port that has both speed and duplex configured disables autonegotiation.

A single-line ACL has been added to a router configuration using the command ip access-list 1 permit 172.16.4.0 0.0.1.255. The configuration also includes the ip access-class 1 in command in VTY configuration mode. Which answer accurately describes how the router uses ACL 1?
A Hosts in subnet 172.16.4.0/23 alone can log in but cannot reach enable mode of the router.
B The router will only forward packets with source addresses in subnet 172.16.4.0/23.
C Hosts in subnet 172.16.4.0/23 alone can telnet into the router.
D CLI users cannot telnet from the router to hosts in subnet 172.16.4.0/23 alone.

Explanation: Answer C is correct.

The ip access-class 1 in command enables ACL 1 for processing inbound Telnet and SSH connections into that router, based on the source IP address of those incoming packets. It has no impact on Telnet or SSH attempts from the router to some other host. It has no impact on a user later reaching enable mode. It also has nothing to do with filtering packets that would otherwise be routed through the router. Note that the ACL matches all packets whose source IP address is in subnet 172.16.4.0/23, which includes the range of numbers from 172.16.4.0 to 172.16.5.255.

Which of the following answers describe the result of the port security configuration created with these commands? (Choose two answers.)
A Prevents unknown devices with unknown MAC addresses from sending data through the switch ports
B Will allow any one device to connect to each port, but will not save that device's MAC address into the startup-config
C Will allow any one device to connect to each port, and will save that device's MAC address into the startup-config
D If a user connects a switch to the cable, prevents multiple devices from sending data through the port

Explanation: Answers B and D are correct.

First, about the sticky parameter… this command causes the switch to learn the source MAC, and to add it to a switchport port-security mac-address address interface subcommand. However, port security adds that command to the running-config file; the network engineer must also issue a copy running-config startup-config EXEC command to save that configuration.

About the other correct answer, users can connect a switch to the end of the cable, with multiple devices connected to that switch. That happens in real networks when users decide they need more ports at their desk. However, the default setting of switchport port-security maximum 1 means that a frame from the second unique source MAC address would cause a violation, and with the default violation action, to err-disable the port.

For the other incorrect answer, the configuration does not prevent unknown MAC addresses from accessing the port, because the configuration does not predefine any MAC address.

Some IOS commands store passwords as clear text, but you can then encrypt the passwords with the service password-encryption global command. By comparison, other commands store a computed hash of the password, rather than storing the password. Comparing the two options, which one answer is the most accurate about why one method is better than the other?

A Using hashes is preferred because encrypted IOS passwords can be easily decrypted.
B Using hashes is preferred because of the large CPU effort required for encryption.
C Using encryption is preferred because it provides stronger password protection.
D Using encryption is preferred because of the large CPU effort required for hashes.

Explanation: Answer A is correct.

The service password-encryption command encrypts passwords on a router or switch that would otherwise be shown in clear text. While a great idea in concept, the algorithm can be easily broken using websites found in the Internet. Cisco long ago provided replacements for commands that store passwords as clear text, instead using hashes - commands like enable secret and username secret. These commands are preferred in part because they avoid the issues of clear-text passwords and easily decrypted passwords.

Which of the following is required when configuring port security with sticky learning?

A Defining the specific allowed MAC addresses using the switchport port-security mac-address interface subcommand
B All the other answers list required commands
C Setting the maximum number of allowed MAC addresses on the interface with the switchport port-security maximum interface subcommand
D Enabling port security with the switchport port-security interface subcommand

Explanation: Answer D is correct.

The setting for the maximum number of MAC addresses has a default of 1, so the switchport port-security maximum command does not have to be configured. With sticky learning, you do not need to predefine the specific MAC addresses either. However, you must enable port security, which requires the switchport port-security interface subcommand.

A switch's port Gi0/1 has been correctly enabled with port security. The configuration sets the violation mode to restrict. A frame that violates the port security policy enters the interface, followed by a frame that does not. Which of the following answers correctly describe what happens in this scenario? (Choose two answers.)

A The switch discards both the first and second frame.
B The switch increments the violation counter for Gi0/1 by 1.
C The switch generates syslog messages about the violating traffic for the first frame.
D The switch puts the interface into an err-disabled state when the first frame arrives.

Explanation: Answers B and C are correct.

First, about the two incorrect answers: When in restrict mode, the arrival of a frame that violates the port security policy does not cause the switch to put the interface into err-disabled state. It does cause the switch to discard any frames that violate the policy, but it leaves the interface up, and does not discard frames that do not violate the security policy, like the second frame that arrives.

Regarding the two correct answers, a port in port security restrict does cause the switch to issue log messages for a violating frame, send SNMP traps about that same event (if SNMP is configured), and to increment the counter of violating frames.

Which of the following is true about what occurs the next time a user logs in from the console?
A No banner text is displayed.
B The banner text "Login banner configured, no text defined" is displayed.
C The banner text "this is the login banner" is displayed.
D The banner text "his is " is displayed.

Explanation: Answer D is correct.

The first nonblank character after the banner login phrase is interpreted as the beginning delimiter character. In this case, it's the letter t. So, the second letter t - the first letter in "the" - is interpreted as the ending delimiter. The resulting login banner is the text between these two ts - namely, "his is ".

Which of the following is true about users of this router?
A The router will hash the clear-text password that the user types to compare to the hashed password.
B A no service password-encryption configuration command would decrypt this password.
C The router will decrypt the password in the configuration to compare to the clear-text password typed by the user.
D A user must type $1$ZGMA$e8cmvkz4UjiJhVp7.maLE1 to reach enable mode.

Explanation: Answer A is correct.

The enable secret command stores an MD5 hash of the password. It is unaffected by the service password-encryption command. The router does not unhash the value back to the clear-text password. Instead, when the user types her clear-text password, the router also hashes that password and compares that hashed value with the hashed value as listed in the configuration.

A user has sent a request to the server. What process does the server go through to determine what service is being requested by the user?
A Encapsulation
B De-encapsulation
C Segmentation
D Fragmentation
E Data translation

Explanation: Answer B is correct.

As data is sent from a sender to a receiver, the sender encapsulates the data into segments, which are encapsulated into packets, then into frames, and then sent on the wire as bits. The receiver de-encapsulates the PDUs (in the reverse order) to determine what actual data that is being transmitted. Segmentation at Layer 4 is used to chop up large data blocks into smaller parts for transmission. Fragmentation at Layer 3 is used to take a packet that may otherwise be too large to be supported on a given network and chop up the packet into smaller packets for transmission. Data translation may be used at Layer 6 of the OSI model as devices negotiate and interpret the formats that are being used for the data that is being sent or received.

This output comes from a network analysis tool. It lists a group of lines for each header in a PDU, with the frame (data link) header at the top, then the next header (typically the IP header), and so on. The first line in each section has a gray highlight, with the indented lines below each heading line listing details about the fields inside the respective header. You will need to remember some parts of the various headers, and compare those concepts to this output, to answer this question.

The circled field, part of the Ethernet header, lists a value of hex 0800, which in this case means that an IP header follows next (as shown on the line below the circled field.) What is the name of that circled field?

A Length
B Type
C SFD
D Protocol

Explanation: Answer B is correct.

The Type field defines the type of protocol listed inside the frame. The Length field is used for specifying the length of the data field, and is used in the older specifications for Ethernet. The SFD signifies that the next byte begins the Destination MAC field. Protocol is not a field name in an Ethernet header, but it is a darn good distracter.

From the output of R1, which of the following is accurate?

A R1 has learned about the IP address of 10.0.0.1 less than 1 minute ago.
B The Hardware Addr field represents a 32-bit Layer 2 address.
C R1 will use the address of 0019.060c.90c0 as the Layer 3 address to reach 10.0.0.5.
D The address of 0019.060c.90c0 is designed to be assigned to a single network interface card (NIC) and never duplicated on a different NIC.

Explanation: Answer D is correct.

The IEEE defines the format and assignment of LAN addresses. The IEEE requires globally unique unicast MAC addresses on all LAN interface cards. To ensure a unique MAC address, the Ethernet card manufacturers encode the MAC address onto the card. The first half of the address identifies the manufacturer of the card. Each manufacturer assigns a MAC address with its own OUI as the first half of the address, with the second half of the address being assigned a number that this manufacturer has never used on another card. The timer "(min)" indicates how long ago the MAC address was learned or updated. A timers of "-" means that it wasn't dynamically learned and usually represents the device's own MAC address. A hardware address is 48 bits long, is a Layer 2 address, and is represented in 12 hexadecimal characters (with each representing 4 bits).

Your network has been configured with a dynamic routing protocol. As a result, which information is used, from the graphic shown here, when a router is making a routing decision?

A A
B B
C C
D D
E E
F F

Explanation: Answer D is correct.

When making a routing decision, the router looks at the destination IP address of each packet and compares the IP packet's destination IP address to the routing table and finds the route that matches the destination address. This route identifies the outgoing interface of the router, and possibly the next-hop router. Layer 2 addresses are used by Layer 2 switches for forwarding decisions. Source Layer 2 addresses are used by Layer 2 switches to populate the MAC address table and to remember from which ports those MAC addresses were sourced. The source IP address is not used in basic routing decisions. The source or destination TCP port numbers are not used for Layer 3 IP routing.

This task contains the radio buttons and checkboxes for options. The shortcut keys to perform this task are A to H and alt+1 to alt+9.
A Router1 strips the Ethernet header and trailer off the frame received from PC1, never to be used again.
B Router1 encapsulates the Ethernet frame inside an HDLC header and sends the frame to Router2, which extracts the Ethernet frame for forwarding to PC2.
C Router1 strips the Ethernet header and trailer off the frame received from PC1, which is exactly re-created by Router2 before forwarding data to PC2.
D Router1 removes the Ethernet, IP, and TCP headers and rebuilds the appropriate headers before forwarding the packet to Router2.
Explanation: Answer A is correct.

PC1 will send an Ethernet frame to Router1, with PC1's MAC address as the source address and Router1's MAC address as the destination address. Router1 will remove the encapsulated IP packet from that Ethernet frame, discarding the frame header and trailer. Router1 will forward the IP packet by first encapsulating it inside an HDLC frame, but Router1 will not encapsulate the Ethernet frame in the HDLC frame, but rather the IP packet. Router2 will deencapsulate the IP packet from the HDLC frame and forward it onto the Ethernet LAN, adding a new Ethernet header and trailer, but this header will differ. It will list Router2's MAC address as the source address and PC2's MAC address as the destination address.

D The host sends packets to its default gateway if the destination IP address is in the same subnet as the host.
Explanation: Answers B and C are correct.

IPv4 hosts generally use basic two-branch logic. To send an IP packet to another host on the same IP network or subnet that is on the same LAN, the sender sends the IP packet directly to that host. Otherwise, the sender sends the packet to its default router (also called the default gateway).

Which of the following are functions of a routing protocol? (Choose two answers.)

This task contains the radio buttons and checkboxes for options. The shortcut keys to perform this task are A to H and alt+1 to alt+9.
A Advertising known routes to neighboring routers
B Learning routes for subnets directly connected to the router
C Learning routes, and putting those routes into the routing table, for routes advertised to the router by its neighboring routers
D Forwarding IP packets based on a packet's destination IP address
Explanation: Answers A and C are correct.

Routers do all the actions listed in all four answers. However, the routing protocol does the functions in the two listed answers. Independent of the routing protocol, a router learns routes for IP subnets and IP networks directly connected to its interfaces. Routers also forward (route) IP packets, but that process is called IP routing, or IP forwarding, and is an independent process compared to the work of a routing protocol.

A company implements a TCP/IP network, with PC1 sitting on an Ethernet LAN. Which of the following protocols and features requires PC1 to learn information from some other server device?

This task contains the radio buttons and checkboxes for options. The shortcut keys to perform this task are A to H and alt+1 to alt+9.
A ARP
B ping
C DNS
D None of these answers is correct.
Explanation: Answer C is correct.

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) does allow PC1 to learn information, but the information is not stored on a server. The ping command does let the user at PC1 learn whether packets can flow in the network, but it again does not use a server. With the Domain Name System (DNS), PC1 acts as a DNS client, relying on a DNS server to respond with information about the IP addresses that match a given hostname.

Fred opens a web browser and connects to the www.certskills.com website. Which of the following are typically true about what happens between Fred's web browser and the web server? (Choose two answers.)

This task contains the radio buttons and checkboxes for options. The shortcut keys to perform this task are A to H and alt+1 to alt+9.
A Messages flowing toward the server use UDP destination port 80.
B Messages flowing from the server typically use RTP.
C Messages flowing to the client typically use a source TCP port number of 80.
D Messages flowing to the server typically use TCP.
Explanation: Answers C and D are correct.

Web traffic uses TCP as the transport protocol, with HTTP as the application protocol. As a result, the web server typically uses well-known TCP port 80, which is the well-known port for HTTP traffic. Messages flowing to the web server would have a destination TCP port of 80, and messages flowing from the server would have a source TCP port of 80.

Which of the following was a short-term solution to the IPv4 address exhaustion problem?

This task contains the radio buttons and checkboxes for options. The shortcut keys to perform this task are A to H and alt+1 to alt+9.
A IP version 6
B IP version 5
C NAT/PAT
D ARP
Explanation: Answer C is correct.

NAT, specifically the PAT feature that allows many hosts to use private IPv4 addresses while being supported by a single public IPv4 address, was one short-term solution to the IPv4 address exhaustion problem. IP version 5 existed briefly as an experimental protocol and had nothing to do with IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 directly addresses the IPv4 address exhaustion problem, but it is a long-term solution. ARP has no impact on the number of IPv4 addresses used.

A router receives an Ethernet frame that holds an IPv6 packet. The router then makes a decision to route the packet out a serial link. Which of the following statements is true about how a router forwards an IPv6 packet?

This task contains the radio buttons and checkboxes for options. The shortcut keys to perform this task are A to H and alt+1 to alt+9.
A The router discards the Ethernet data-link header and trailer of the received frame.
B The router makes the forwarding decision based on the packet's source IPv6 address.
C The router keeps the Ethernet header, encapsulating the entire frame inside a new IPv6 packet before sending it over the serial link.
D The router uses the IPv4 routing table when choosing where to forward the packet.
Explanation: Answer A is correct.

Routers use the same process steps when routing IPv6 packets as they do when routing IPv4 packets. Routers route IPv6 packets based on the IPv6 addresses, listed inside the IPv6 header in the IPv6 packets, by comparing the destination IPv6 address to the router's IPv6 routing table. As a result, the router discards the incoming frame's data-link header and trailer, leaving an IPv6 packet. The router compares the destination (not source) IPv6 address in the header to the router's IPv6 (not IPv4) routing table and then forwards the packet based on the matched route.

Which of the following is the prefix for address 2000:0000:0000:0005:6000:0700:0080:0009, assuming a mask of /64?

This task contains the radio buttons and checkboxes for options. The shortcut keys to perform this task are A to H and alt+1 to alt+9.
A 2000::5::/64
B 2000::5:0:0:0:0/64
C 2000:0:0:5::/64
D 2000:0:0:5:0:0:0:0/64
Explanation: Answer C is correct.

The /64 prefix length means that the last 64 bits, or last 16 digits, of the address should be changed to all 0s. That process leaves the unabbreviated prefix as 2000:0000:0000:0005:0000:0000:0000:0000. The last four quartets are all 0s, making that string of all 0s be the longest and best string of 0s to replace with ::. After removing the leading 0s in other quartets, the answer is 2000:0:0:5::/64.

C FE80::100:0:0:0:123:4567
D FE80:0:0:100::123
Explanation: Answer D is correct.

If following the steps in the book, the first step removes up to three leading 0s in each quartet, leaving FE80:0:0:100:0:0:0:123. This leaves two strings of consecutive all-0 quartets; by changing the longest string of all 0s to ::, the address is FE80:0:0:100::123.

C 2000:300:4:5:6000:700:8:9
D 2000:3:4:5:6:7:8:9
Explanation: Answer B is correct.

This question has many quartets that make it easy to make a common mistake: removing trailing 0s in a quartet of hex digits. To abbreviate IPv6 addresses, only leading 0s in a quartet should be removed. Many of the quartets have trailing 0s (0s on the right side of the quartet), so make sure to not remove those 0s.

D 2001:0DB8:0000:0000:0000:0000:200:0028
Explanation: Answer A is correct.

The unabbreviated version of an IPv6 address must have 32 digits, and only one answer has 32 hex digits. In this case, the original number shows four quartets and a ::. So, the :: was replaced with four quartets of 0000, making the number have eight quartets. Then, for each quartet with fewer than four digits, leading 0s were added so that each quartet has four hex digits.

Two routers, R1 and R2, connect using an Ethernet over MPLS service. The service provides point-to-point service between these two routers only, as a Layer 2 Ethernet service. Which of the following are the most likely to be true about this WAN? (Choose two answers.)
A R1 will connect to a physical Ethernet link, with the other end of the cable connected to R2
B R1 will connect to a physical Ethernet link, with the other end of the cable connected to a device at the WAN service provider point of presence.
C R1 will forward data-link frames to R2 using an HDLC header/trailer.
D R1 will forward data-link frames to R2 using an Ethernet header/trailer.
Explanation: Answers B and D are correct.

The physical installation uses a model in which each router uses a physical Ethernet link to connect to some SP device in an SP facility called a point of presence (PoP). The Ethernet link does not span from each customer device to the other. From a data-link perspective, both routers use the same Ethernet standard header and trailer used on LANs; HDLC does not matter on these Ethernet WAN links.

Which of the following statements describes part of the process of how a switch decides to forward a frame destined for a known unicast MAC address?
A It compares the unicast destination address to the bridging, or MAC address, table.
B It compares the unicast source address to the bridging, or MAC address, table.
C It forwards the frame out all interfaces in the same VLAN except for the incoming interface.
D It compares the destination IP address to the destination MAC address.
E It compares the frame's incoming interface to the source MAC entry in the MAC address table.
Explanation: Answer A is correct.

A switch compares the destination MAC address to the MAC address table. If a matching entry is found, the switch forwards the frame out the appropriate interface. If no matching entry is found, the switch floods the frame.

Which of the following comparisons does a switch make when deciding whether a new MAC address should be added to its MAC address table?
A It compares the unicast destination address to the bridging, or MAC address, table.
B It compares the unicast source address to the bridging, or MAC address, table.
C It compares the VLAN ID to the bridging, or MAC address, table.
D. It compares the destination IP address's ARP cache entry to the bridging, or MAC address, table.
Explanation: Answer B is correct.

Switches need to learn the location of each MAC address used in the LAN relative to that local switch. When a switch receives a frame, the source MAC identifies the sender. The interface in which the frame arrives identifies the local switch interface closest to that node in the LAN topology.

In a three-tier campus LAN design, which of the following are typically true of the topology design? (Choose two answers.)
A The design uses a partial mesh of links between access and distribution switches
B The design uses a full mesh of links between access and distribution switches
C The design uses a partial mesh of links between the distribution and core switches
D The end user and server devices connect directly to distribution layer switches
Explanation: Answers A and C are correct.

The access layer switches, not the distribution layer switches, play the role of connecting to the endpoint devices, whether they are end-user devices or servers. Then, from the access to the distribution layer, each access layer connects to two distribution switches typically, but with no direct connections between access layer switches, creating a mesh, but a partial mesh. A three-tier design, also called a core design, does use core switches, with a partial mesh of links between the distribution and core switches. Basically, each distribution switch connects to multiple core switches, but often does not connect directly to other distribution switches.

A Trunking turned trunk
B dynamic auto
C dynamic desirable
D access
E None of the other answers are correct.
Explanation: Answers A and C are correct.

The dynamic auto setting means that the switch can negotiate trunking, but it can only respond to negotiation messages, and it cannot initiate the negotiation process. So, the other switch must be configured to trunk or to initiate the negotiation process (based on being configured with the dynamic desirable option).

Which answers describe a good practice in applying good troubleshooting methodologies? (Choose two answers.)

A Perform problem isolation as fast as possible, including not slowing down to document your findings.
B The last step in a good troubleshooting process should be to take action to resolve the root cause of the problem.
C The last step in a good troubleshooting process should include monitoring the status to ensure that the problem is indeed solved and does not recur.
D Each worker should know and use the escalation process when they cannot resolve a particular problem.

Explanation: Answers C and D are correct.

This question asks about a topic that, by nature, is subjective. Cisco does not dictate a particular pre-defined troubleshooting methodology. However, many good practices make good common sense and work in real networks. The incorrect answers to this question were chosen to be a bit obvious just to make the point about what Cisco does mention about troubleshooting methods in the exam topics, because this question takes those exam topics and builds in some common sense as applied to the exam topics.

One incorrect answer says to now slow down to document problems is contrary to one of the exam topics, and is certainly against good troubleshooting practices. Do problem isolation, and record your findings.

Two answers state what the last step in the troubleshooting process should be, so one must be incorrect, possibly both (that is, only one step could be the last step). Resolving the problem is not the last step. After resolving the problem, the person working the problem should verify that the problem is indeed solved, and possibly monitor the status for a period of time before considering the problem resolved.

The answer that mentions the escalation process basically defines a good process: if the engineer cannot resolve the problem, they should know how to escalate the problem to another engineer or manager, and they should indeed follow that process.

C
The link runs at 1 Gbps, but SW1 uses half-duplex and SW2 uses full duplex.
D

Explanation: Answers A and D are correct.

SW2 has effectively disabled IEEE standard autonegotiation by configuring both speed and duplex. However, Cisco switches can detect the speed used by the other device, even with autonegotiation turned off. Also, at 1 Gbps, the IEEE autonegotiation standard says to use full duplex. If the duplex setting cannot be negotiated, so both ends use 1 Gbps, full duplex.

This task contains the radio buttons and checkboxes for options. The shortcut keys to perform this task are A to H and alt+1 to alt+9.
A
The show interface status command lists the interface status as connected.
B
The show interface status command lists the interface status as err-disabled.
C
The show port-security interface command could list a mode of shutdown or restrict, but not protect.
D
The show port-security interface command could list a violation counter value of 10.

Explanation: Answer B is correct.

The question states that the port security status is secure-shutdown. This state is only used by the shutdown port security mode, and when used, it means that the interface has been placed into an err-disabled state. Those facts give the facts as to why the correct answer is correct, and why two of the incorrect answers are incorrect.

The incorrect answer that mentions the violation counter is incorrect because in shutdown mode, the counter no longer increments once the interface is placed into secure-shutdown mode, and resets to 0 once the interface is reset with the shutdown and then no shutdown commands.

SW1# show interfaces gigabit0/1 switchport

Name: Gi0/1

Switchport: Enabled

Administrative Mode: trunk

Operational Mode: trunk

This task contains the radio buttons and checkboxes for options. The shortcut keys to perform this task are A to H and alt+1 to alt+9.
A
The operational state per show interfaces switchport must be "trunk."
B

C
SW2 must use the switchport mode trunk configuration command on G0/2, or the link will not use trunking.
D
SW2 can use the switchport mode dynamic auto configuration command as one option to make the link use trunking.

Explanation: Answer D is correct.

The show interface switchport command lists a switch's configured value of the switchport mode command as the administrative mode, telling us that SW1 uses the switchport mode trunk configuration command. The operation state shows the current working state (trunk). Of the four answers, one incorrect answer claims that SW2's operational state must also be "trunk"; however, one switch can use trunking, while the other does not. Another answer claims that the administrative mode must be "trunk," which basically means that the command switchport mode trunk must be used. However, SW2 has a few other configuration options that would work, like the switchport mode dynamic desirable and switchport mode dynamic auto commands, with the correct answer referring to one of those commands (the switchport mode dynamic auto command).

A Class B network needs to be subnetted such that it supports 100 subnets and 100 hosts/subnet. Which of the following answers list a workable combination for the number of network, subnet, and host bits? (Choose two answers.)

This task contains the radio buttons and checkboxes for options. The shortcut keys to perform this task are A to H and alt+1 to alt+9.
A
Network = 16, subnet = 7, host = 7
B
Network = 16, subnet = 8, host = 8
C
Network = 16, subnet = 9, host = 7
D
Network = 8, subnet = 7, host = 17

Explanation: Answers B and C are correct.

At least 7 subnet bits are needed, because 26 = 64, so 6 subnet bits could not number 100 different subnets. Seven subnet bits could, because 27 = 128 => 100. Similarly, 6 host bits is not enough, because 26 − 2 = 62, but 7 host bits is enough, because 27 − 2 = 126 => 100.

The number of network, subnet, and host bits must total 32 bits, making one of the answers incorrect. The answer with 8 network bits cannot be correct because the question states that a Class B network is used, so the number of network bits must always be 16. The two correct answers have 16 network bits (required because the question states the use of a Class B network), and at least 7 subnet and host bits each.

Why does the formula for the number of hosts per subnet (2H - 2) require the subtraction of two hosts?

This task contains the radio buttons and checkboxes for options. The shortcut keys to perform this task are A to H and alt+1 to alt+9.
A
To reserve two addresses for redundant default gateways (routers)
B
To reserve the two addresses required for DHCP operation
C
To reserve addresses for the subnet ID and default gateway (router)
D
To reserve addresses for the subnet broadcast address and subnet ID

Explanation: Answer D is correct.

By definition, two address values in every IPv4 subnet cannot be used as host IPv4 addresses: the first (lowest) numeric value in the subnet for the subnet ID, and the last (highest) numeric value in the subnet for the subnet broadcast address.

Host A is a PC, connected to switch SW1 and assigned to VLAN 1. Which of the following are typically assigned an IP address in the same subnet as host A? (Choose two answers.)

This task contains the radio buttons and checkboxes for options. The shortcut keys to perform this task are A to H and alt+1 to alt+9.
A
The local router's WAN interface
B
The local router's LAN interface
C
All other hosts attached to the same switch
D
Other hosts attached to the same switch and also in VLAN 1

Explanation: Answers B and D are correct.

The general rule to determine whether two devices' interfaces should be in the same subnet is whether the two interfaces are separated from each other by a router. To provide a way for hosts in one VLAN to send data to hosts outside that VLAN, a local router must connect its LAN interface to the same VLAN as the hosts, and have an address in the same subnet as the hosts. All the hosts in that same VLAN on the same switch would not be separated from each other by a router, so these hosts would also be in the same subnet. However, another PC, connected to the same switch but in a different VLAN, will require its packets to flow through a router to reach Host A, so Host A's IP address would need to be in a different subnet compared to this new host.

Lesson: Perspectives on IPv4 Subnetting 


A network engineer spends time thinking about the entire Class B network 172.16.0.0, and how to subnet that network. He then chooses how to subnet this Class B network and creates an addressing and subnetting plan, on paper, showing his choices. If you compare his thoughts about this network before subnetting the network, to his thoughts about this network after mentally subnetting the network, which of the following occurred to the parts of the structure of addresses in this network?

This task contains the radio buttons and checkboxes for options. The shortcut keys to perform this task are A to H and alt+1 to alt+9.
A
The subnet part got smaller.
B
The host part got smaller.
C
The network part got smaller.
D
The host part was removed.
E
The network part was removed.


Explanation: Answer B is correct.

An unsubnetted Class A, B, or C network has two parts: the network and host parts. To perform subnetting, the engineer creates a new subnet part by borrowing host bits, shrinking the number of host bits. The subnet part of the address structure exists only after the engineer chooses a nondefault mask. The network part remains a constant size.

Which of the following is a network broadcast address?

This task contains the radio buttons and checkboxes for options. The shortcut keys to perform this task are A to H and alt+1 to alt+9.
A
10.1.255.255
B
192.168.255.1
C
224.1.1.255
D
172.30.255.255


Explanation: Answer D is correct.

To find the network broadcast address, first determine the class, and then determine the number of host octets. At that point, convert the host octets to 255 to create the network broadcast address. In this case, 10.1.255.255 is in a Class A network, with the last three octets as host octets, for a network broadcast address of 10.255.255.255. For 192.168.255.1, it is a Class C address, with the last octet as the host part, for a network broadcast address of 192.168.255.255. Address 224.1.1.255 is a class D address, so it is not in any unicast IP network, so the question does not apply. For 172.30.255.255, it is a Class B address, with the last two octets as host octets, so the network broadcast address is 172.30.255.255.

All are valid Class B network IDs.


Explanation: Answer E is correct.

Class B networks all begin with values between 128 and 191, inclusive, in their first octets. The network ID has any value in the 128-191 range in the first octet, and any value from 0-255 inclusive in the second octet, with decimal 0s in the final two octets. Two of the answers show a 255 in the second octet, which is acceptable. Two of the answers show a 0 in the second octet, which is also acceptable.

Which of the following statements is true about classless IP addressing concepts?

This task contains the radio buttons and checkboxes for options. The shortcut keys to perform this task are A to H and alt+1 to alt+9.
A
Uses a 128-bit IP address
B
Applies only for Class A and B networks
C
Separates IP addresses into network, subnet, and host parts
D

Explanation: Answer D is correct.

Classless addressing rules define a two-part IP address structure: the prefix and the host part. This logic ignores Class A, B, and C rules, and can be applied to the 32-bit IPv4 addresses from any address class. By ignoring Class A, B, and C rules, classless addressing ignores any distinction as to the network part of an IPv4 address.

Which of the following masks, when used as the only mask within a Class B network, would supply enough subnet bits to support 100 subnets? (Choose two answers.)

This task contains the radio buttons and checkboxes for options. The shortcut keys to perform this task are A to H and alt+1 to alt+9.
A
/24
B
255.255.255.252
C
/20
D
255.255.252.0


Explanation: Answers A and B are correct.

The masks in binary define a number of binary 1s, and the number of binary 1s defines the length of the prefix (network + subnet) part. With a Class B network, the network part is 16 bits. To support 100 subnets, the subnet part must be at least 7 bits long. Six subnet bits would supply only 26 = 64 subnets, while 7 subnet bits supply 27 = 128 subnets. The /24 answer supplies 8 subnet bits, and the 255.255.255.252 answer supplies 14 subnet bits.

C
255.255.255.240
D
255.255.254.0
E
255.255.255.0


Explanation: Answer B is correct.

/30 is the equivalent of the mask that in binary has 30 binary 1s. To convert that to DDN format, write down all the binary 1s (30 in this case), followed by binary 0s for the remainder of the 32-bit mask. Then take 8 bits at a time, and convert from binary to decimal (or memorize the nine possible DDN mask octet values and their binary equivalents). Using the /30 mask in this question, the binary mask is 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111100. Each of the first three octets is all binary 1s, so each converts to 255. The last octet, 11111100, converts to 252, for a DDN mask of 255.255.255.252. See Appendix A for a decimal/binary conversion table.

Explanation: Answer C is correct.

Thinking about the conversion one octet at a time, the first two octets each convert to 8 binary 1s. 254 converts to 8-bit binary 11111110, and decimal 0 converts to 8-bit binary 00000000. So, the total number of binary 1s (which defines the prefix length) is 8 + 8 + 7 + 0 = /23.

Explanation: Answer A is correct.

The size of the network part is always either 8, 16, or 24 bits, based on whether it is Class A, B, or C, respectively. As a Class C address, N=24. The number of subnet bits is the difference between the prefix length (27) and N, so S=3 in this case. The size of the host part is a number that, when added to the prefix length (27), gives you 32, so H=5 in this case.

When thinking about an IP address using classful addressing rules, an address can have three parts: network, subnet, and host. If you examined all the addresses in one subnet, in binary, which of the following answers correctly states which of the three parts of the addresses will be equal among all addresses? (Choose the best answer.)

A
Network part only
B
Subnet part only
C
Host part only
D
Network and subnet parts
E
Subnet and host parts


Explanation: Answer D is correct.

When using classful IP addressing concepts as described in Chapter 14, "Analyzing Subnet Masks," addresses have three parts: network, subnet, and host. For addresses in a single classful network, the network parts must be identical for the numbers to be in the same network. For addresses in the same subnet, both the network and subnet parts must have identical values. The host part differs when comparing different addresses in the same subnet.

Which of the following is the resident subnet for IP address 192.168.44.97/30?

A
192.168.44.0
B
192.168.44.64
C
192.168.44.96
D
192.168.44.128


Explanation: Answer C is correct.

First, the resident subnet (the subnet ID of the subnet in which the address resides) must be numerically smaller than the IP address, which rules out one of the answers. The mask converts to 255.255.255.252. As such, you can copy the first three octets of the IP address because of their value of 255. For the fourth octet, the subnet ID value must be a multiple of 4, because 256 − 252 (mask) = 4. Those multiples include 96 and 100, and the right choice is the multiple closest to the IP address value in that octet (97) without going over. So, the correct subnet ID is 192.168.44.96.
Lesson: Analyzing Existing Subnets 


Which of the following statements are true regarding the binary subnet ID, subnet broadcast address, and host IP address values in any single subnet? (Choose two answers.)


A
The host part of the broadcast address is all binary 0s.
B
The host part of the subnet ID is all binary 0s.
C
The host part of a usable IP address can have all binary 1s.
D
The host part of any usable IP address must not be all binary 0s.


Explanation: Answers B and D are correct.

In any subnet, the subnet ID is the smallest number in the range, the subnet broadcast address is the largest number, and the usable IP addresses sit between them. All numbers in a subnet have identical binary values in the prefix part (classless view) and network + subnet part (classful view). To be the lowest number, the subnet ID must have the lowest possible binary value (all 0s) in the host part. To be the largest number, the broadcast address must have the highest possible binary value (all binary 1s) in the host part. The usable addresses do not include the subnet ID and subnet broadcast address, so the addresses in the range of usable IP address never have a value of all 0s or 1s in their host parts.

Which of the following is the resident subnet ID for IP address 10.7.99.133/24?


A
10.0.0.0
B
10.7.0.0
C
10.7.99.0
D
10.7.99.128


Explanation: Answer C is correct.

The mask converts to 255.255.255.0. To find the subnet ID, for each octet of the mask that is 255, you can copy the IP address's corresponding values. For mask octets of decimal 0, you can record a 0 in that octet of the subnet ID. As such, copy the 10.7.99 and write a 0 for the fourth octet, for a subnet ID of 10.7.99.0.

A fellow engineer tells you to configure the DHCP server to lease the last 100 usable IP addresses in subnet 10.1.4.0/23. Which of the following IP addresses could be leased as a result of your new configuration?


A
10.1.4.156
B
10.1.4.254
C
10.1.5.200
D
10.1.7.200
E
10.1.255.200



Explanation: Answer C is correct.

To answer this question, you need to find the range of addresses in the subnet, which typically then means you need to calculate the subnet ID and subnet broadcast address. With subnet ID/mask of 10.1.4.0/23, the mask converts to 255.255.254.0. To find the subnet broadcast address, following the decimal process described in this chapter, you can copy the subnet ID's first two octets because the mask's value is 255 in each octet. You write a 255 in the fourth octet because the mask has a 0 on the fourth octet. In octet 3, the interesting octet, add the magic number (2) to the subnet ID's value (4), minus 1, for a value of 2 + 4 − 1 = 5. (The magic number in this case is calculated as 256 − 254 = 2.) That makes the broadcast address 10.1.5.255. The last usable address is 1 less: 10.1.5.254. The range that includes the last 100 addresses is 10.1.5.155−10.1.5.254.

B
172.31.255.255
C
172.31.77.223
D
172.31.77.207


Explanation: Answer C is correct.

The resident subnet ID in this case is 172.31.77.192. You can find the subnet broadcast address based on the subnet ID and mask using several methods. Following the decimal process in the book, the mask converts to 255.255.255.224, making the interesting octet be octet 4, with magic number 256 − 224 = 32. For the three octets where the mask = 255, copy the subnet ID (172.31.77). For the interesting octet, take the subnet ID value (192), add magic (32), and subtract 1, for 223. That makes the subnet broadcast address 172.31.77.223.

A PC user opens a command prompt and uses the ipconfig command to see that the PC's IP address and mask are 192.168.4.77 and 255.255.255.224. The user then runs a test using the ping 192.168.4.117 command. Which of the following answers is the most likely to happen?


A
The PC sends packets directly to the host with address 192.168.4.117.
B
The PC sends packets to its default gateway.
C
The PC sends a DNS query for 192.168.4.117.
D
The PC sends an ARP looking for the MAC address of the DHCP server.


Explanation: Answer B is correct.

PCs use two-option logic: send local packets (destined for hosts in the same subnet) directly, and send remote packets (destined for hosts in other subnets) to the default gateway/router. In this case, the PC's own IP address is 192.168.4.77, with mask 255.255.255.224, so it is in subnet 192.168.4.64/27. This subnet has a range of addresses from 192.168.4.64 to 192.168.4.95, including the subnet and broadcast address. As a result, the PC sends the packet to its default gateway. As for the other incorrect answers, if the ping command had used a hostname, it would have first asked a DNS server to resolve the name. Also, the PC already has an IP address, so DHCP would not be needed.

A Layer 3 switch has been configured to route IP packets between VLANs 1, 2, and 3, which connect to subnets 172.20.1.0/25, 172.20.2.0/25, and 172.20.3.0/25, respectively. The engineer issues a show ip route command on the Layer 3 switch, listing the connected routes. Which of the following answers lists a piece of information that should be in at least one of the routes?


A
Interface Gigabit Ethernet 0/0.3
B
Next-hop router 172.20.4.1
C
Interface VLAN 2
D
Mask 255.255.255.0


Explanation: Answer C is correct.

The configuration of the Layer 3 switch's routing feature uses VLAN interfaces, with the interface number matching the VLAN ID. The matching connected routes, like all connected IP routes, will list the interfaces but not a next-hop IP address. The three connected routes will list the VLAN interfaces 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

A network engineer configures the ip route 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 s0/0/0 command on a router, and then issues a show ip route command from enable mode. No routes for subnet 10.1.1.0/24 appear in the output. Which of the following could be true?

This task contains the radio buttons and checkboxes for options. The shortcut keys to perform this task are A to H and alt+1 to alt+9.
A
The ip route command has incorrect syntax and was rejected in config mode.
B
Interface s0/0/0 is down.
C
The router has no up/up interfaces in class A network 10.0.0.0.
D
The ip route command is missing a next-hop router IP address.


Explanation: Answer B is correct.

The ip route command can reference an outgoing interface or a next-hop IP address, which rules out one answer. The command does use the correct syntax, ruling out another answer. There is no requirement for a router to have any particular interface IP addresses in relation to the configuration of an ip route command, ruling out yet another answer.

The checks that IOS uses when looking at a new ip route command include: is the outgoing interface up/up, is the next-hop address reachable, and if there is a competing route from another source, does the other route have a better administrative distance.

A
The destination subnet's subnet ID
B
The next-hop router's IP address
C
The next-hop router's neighboring interface
D
The subnet mask


Explanation: Answer C is correct.

The ip route command can refer to the IP address of the next-hop router or to the local router's interface. It also refers to the subnet ID and matching subnet mask, defining the range of addresses matched by the route.

An enterprise puts the DHCP and DNS servers on VLAN 10/subnet 10 in Atlanta, using IP address 10.1.10.1 for the DHCP server and 10.1.10.2 for the DNS server. A remote router sits in Boston, with devices on the Boston LAN using the DHCP and DNS servers in Atlanta. Which of the following needs to be configured in the routers in this enterprise to support DHCP and DNS?


A
The ip helper-address 10.1.10.1 command in the Atlanta router
B
The ip helper-address 10.1.10.2 command in the Boston router
C
The ip name-server 10.1.10.2 command in the Atlanta router
D
The ip dhcp-server 10.1.10.1 command in the Boston router
E
None of the other answers is correct.


Explanation: Answer E is correct.

Of the commands in the answers, three list syntactically correct commands, but one does not: ip dhcp-server 10.1.10.1. The answer with this command is incorrect. The ip helper-address 10.1.10.1 command is indeed needed as an interface subcommand, but only on remote routers like the Boston router. This command is not needed for the DNS server, so while the ip helper-address 10.1.10.2 command would be accepted, it does not help DNS or DHCP work. Finally, the ip name-server 10.1.10.2 command on the Atlanta router works, but it simply lets users of the Atlanta router CLI make use of the DNS server; it has no effect on user DNS traffic.

The Boston router would need an ip helper-address 10.1.10.1 command, so that the Boston router could forward DHCP requests to the DHCP server in Atlanta.

Fred decides to migrate from an old DHCP server platform to use a Cisco router at the headquarters building. This DHCP server, created with configuration in IOS on a Cisco router, supports 200 remote subnets. Which of the following settings are made outside of a per-subnet pool of addresses?


A
Client IP address
B
Addresses in that subnet excluded from being leased by the server
C
Default router
D
DNS server
E
Length of address lease


Explanation: Answer B is correct.

The configuration puts the per-client settings in a DHCP pool: client IP address, mask, default router, and DNS server IP addresses. The pool also lists the length of time for which the client can keep the lease for the address. Only the exclude list (ip dhcp exclude-address) sits outside the DHCP pool.

PC1, a new PC, just booted for the first time when connected to an enterprise network. PC1 used DHCP to lease IP address 10.1.1.1, learning mask 255.255.255.0, DNS server 10.9.9.9, and default gateway 10.1.1.2, with a lease time of 7 days. Assume that the PC has sent nothing else over the network because the DHCP process completed. The user then opens a web browser and types www.ciscopress.com. Which of the following actions happens next? 


A
PC1 sends an ARP request to find the web server’s MAC address
B
PC1 sends an ARP request to find the default gateway’s (10.1.1.2) MAC address
C
PC1 sends a DNS request about www.ciscopress.com to the DNS server (10.9.9.9)
D
PC1 sends an IP packet to the www.ciscopress.com web server IP address


Explanation: Answer B is correct.

If a host does not yet have an IPv4 address assigned to it, the first action should be to try and lease an address with DHCP. The question begins as if that process had completed, but also that nothing else had happened on the network. That statement is meant to say that no ARPs had flows, no DNS messages had flowed, and certainly no user messages.

When the user types www.ciscopress.com into his browser window, PC1 needs to resolve the name into its IPv4 address. However, the DNS, 10.9.9.9, is on a different subnet than PC1. PC1 does not learn an ARP entry for the default router during the DHCP process. (Remember, all those DHCP messages sent by the DHCP client are not sent to the router’s MAC address.) So although PC1’s next primary action is to resolve the name www.ciscopress.com into its IP address, the next message in an ARP Request for 10.1.1.2 from PC1, so that PC1 can then know R1’s MAC address, and forward the DNS request to router R1.

Of the incorrect answers, after the ARP request to find the default router’s MAC address, PC1 will send a DNS request, and then send an IP packet to the server’s IP address. And if the server just happens to be in the same subnet as PC1, PC1 would also ARP to find the web server’s IP address.

A packet is sent to a destination address. That single packet is routed through the network to the final router, which then sends the packet to all hosts connected to that one subnet. Which of the following IP address types was used as the destination IP address?


A
A unicast address
B
A network broadcast address
C
A subnet broadcast address
D
A multicast address


Explanation: Answer C is correct.

By definition, a subnet broadcast (a packet sent to a subnet broadcast address), also called a directed broadcast, is routed like any other packet until it arrives at a router connected to that subnet. For that last forwarding step, the router encapsulates the IP packet in an Ethernet broadcast frame (destination MAC address FFFF.FFFF.FFFF), so that all hosts in the destination subnet receive a copy.

A unicast packet would not be forwarded as a data link broadcast at the last step.

A network broadcast would be replicated by different routers as needed so that it was delivered to all subnets in the classful network.

A multicast packet would be delivered to a subset of subnets, depending on which subnets had hosts who had formerly asked to receive packets sent to that particular multicast address. 
Lesson: DHCP and IP Networking on Hosts
Objective: IPv4 Address Types


A packet is sent to a destination address. That single packet is replicated by a few routers based on the routers’ knowledge of hosts that had earlier registered to receive packets sent to that destination address. The routers do not forward copies of the packet onto subnets where no hosts have registered, and do forward copies of the packet onto subnets where at least one host has registered to receive those packets. Which of the following IP address types was used as the destination IP address?



A
A unicast address
B
A network broadcast address
C
A subnet broadcast address
D
A multicast address


Explanation: Answer D is correct.

By definition, a multicast IP packet (a packet sent to a Class D IP multicast address) is copied as necessary by routers to make extra copies, and forwarded to multiple routers as needed, but not all. The logic revolves around prior knowledge of a host registration process by which hosts declare their interest in receiving packets sent to a particular multicast IP address. Routers exchange this information, so that when a new multicast packet arrives, the routers know where to send copies of that particular multicast packet, and where to not bother to send the packet (because no hosts in that part of the network registered to receive a copy).

A unicast packet would not be forwarded as a data link broadcast at the last step.

A network broadcast would be replicated by different routers as needed so that it was delivered to all subnets in the classful network.

A subnet broadcast would be router as a single packet to the final router in the path. That router would then forward the IP packet as a LAN broadcast so that all hosts in that subnet would receive a copy.

An IP subnetting design effort is under way at a company. So far, the senior engineer has decided to use Class B network 172.23.0.0. The design calls for 100 subnets, with the largest subnet needing 500 hosts. Management requires that the design accommodate 50 percent growth in the number of subnets and the size of the largest subnet. The requirements also state that a single mask must be used throughout the Class B network. How many masks meet the requirements?

A 0
B 1
C 2
D 3+


Explanation: Answer A is correct.

With 50 percent growth, the mask needs to define enough subnet bits to create 150 subnets. As a result, the mask needs at least 8 subnet bits (7 subnet bits supply 27, or 128, subnets, and 8 subnet bits supply 28, or 256, subnets). Similarly, the need for 50 percent growth in the size for the largest subnet means that the host part needs enough bits to number 750 hosts/subnet. Nine host bits are not enough (29 - 2 = 510), but 10 host bits supply 1022 hosts/subnet (210 - 2 = 1022). With 16 network bits existing because of the choice to use a Class B network, the design needs a total of 34 bits (at least) in the mask (16 network, 8 subnet, 10 host), but only 32 bits exist - so no single mask meets the requirements.

In a router running a recent IOS version (at least version 15.0), an engineer needs to delete the second line in ACL 101, which currently has four commands configured. Which of the following options could be used? (Choose two answers.)


A Delete the entire ACL and reconfigure the three ACL statements that should remain in the ACL.
B Delete one line from the ACL using the no access-list... global command.
C Delete one line from the ACL by entering ACL configuration mode for the ACL and then deleting only the second line based on its sequence number.
D Delete the last three lines from the ACL from global configuration mode, and then add the last two statements back into the ACL.

Explanation: Answers A and C are correct.

Before IOS 12.3, numbered ACLs must be removed and then reconfigured to remove a line from the ACL. As of IOS 12.3, you can also use ACL configuration mode and sequence numbers to delete one ACL line at a time.

E access-list 2523 permit tcp host 10.1.1.1 172.16.5.0 0.0.0.255 eq www

Explanation: Answers A and E are correct.

The correct range of ACL numbers for extended IP access lists is 100 to 199 and 2000 to 2699. The answers that list the eq www parameter after 10.1.1.1 match the source port number, and the packets are going toward the web server, not away from it.

Which of the following access-list commands permits packets going to any web client from all web servers whose IP addresses begin with 172.16.5?


A access-list 101 permit tcp host 10.1.1.1 172.16.5.0 0.0.0.255 eq www
B access-list 1951 permit ip host 10.1.1.1 172.16.5.0 0.0.0.255 eq www
C access-list 2523 permit tcp any eq www 172.16.5.0 0.0.0.255
D access-list 2523 permit tcp 172.16.5.0 0.0.0.255 eq www 172.16.5.0 0.0.0.255
E access-list 2523 permit tcp 172.16.5.0 0.0.0.255 eq www any

Explanation: Answer E is correct.

Because the packet is going toward any web client, you need to check for the web server’s port number as a source port. The client IP address range is not specified in the question, but the servers are, so the source address beginning with 172.16.5 is the correct answer.

An engineer configures an ACL but forgets to save the configuration. At that point, which of the following commands displays the configuration of an IPv4 ACL, including line numbers? (Choose two answers.)

A show running-config

C show ip access-lists
D show access-lists

Explanation: Answers C and D are correct.

The show ip access-lists and show access-lists commands both display the configuration of IPv4 access lists, including ACL line numbers. Neither the show running-config nor show startup-config commands list the ACL line numbers; in this case, the startup-config file would not contain the ACL configuration at all.

An engineer is considering configuring an ACL on router R1. The engineer could use ACL A which would be enabled with the ip access-group A out command on interface G0/1, or ACL B, which would be enabled with the ip access-group B in command on that same interface. R1’s G0/1 interface uses IPv4 address 1.1.1.1. Which of the answers is true when comparing these options? (Choose two answers.)

A ACL A creates more risk of filtering important overhead traffic than ACL B.
B ACL B creates more risk of filtering important overhead traffic than ACL A.
C A ping 1.1.1.1 command on R1 would bypass ACL A even if enabled.
D A ping 1.1.1.1 command on R1 would bypass ACL B even if enabled.

Explanation: Answers B and C are correct.

A router bypasses the ACL logic for its own outbound ACLs for packets created by that router. Routers do not make any kind of exception for inbound packets. As a result, ACL B creates more risk than ACL A, because B is enabled as an inbound ACL.

The ping 1.1.1.1 command in two answers is a self-ping of a router’s Ethernet interface. As a result, the router would bypass any outbound ACL logic on that interface, but consider any inbound ACL logic. So router R1 would bypass the logic of ACL A, which would be enabled as an outbound ACL on R1’s G0/1 interface.

A Cisco Catalyst switch connects with its Gigabit0/1 port to an end user's PC. The end user, thinking the user is helping, manually sets the PC's OS to use a speed of 1000 Mbps and to use full duplex, and disables the use of autonegotiation. The switch's G0/1 port has default settings for speed and duplex. What speed and duplex settings will the switch decide to use? (Choose two answers.)

This task contains the radio buttons and checkboxes for options. The shortcut keys to perform this task are A to H and alt+1 to alt+9.


A Full duplex
B Half duplex
C 10 Mbps
D 1000 Mbps
Explanation: Answers A and D are correct.

The IEEE autonegotiation rules define that if a device attempts autonegotiation, but the other side does not participate, to use the slowest speed it supports. However, Cisco switches override that logic, instead sampling the electrical signal to detect the speed used by the connected device, so the switch will operate at 1000 Mbps. The switch uses the IEEE default setting for duplex based on the speed, and the IEEE default for duplex when using 1000 Mbps is to use full duplex. So in this case, the switch will match both the speed and duplex setting made on the PC. 


In which of the following modes of the CLI could you configure the duplex setting for interface Fast Ethernet 0/5?


A User mode
B Enable mode
C Global configuration mode
D VLAN mode
E Interface configuration mode
Explanation: Answer E is correct.

Cisco switches can be configured for speed (with the speed command) and duplex (with the duplex command) in interface configuration mode.

Which of the following describes a way to disable IEEE standard autonegotiation on a 10/100 port on a Cisco switch?


A Configure the negotiate disable interface subcommand
B Configure the no negotiate interface subcommand
C Configure the speed 100 interface subcommand
D Configure the duplex half interface subcommand
E Configure the duplex full interface subcommand
F Configure the speed 100 and duplex full interface subcommands
Explanation: Answer F is correct.

Cisco switches do not have a command to disable autonegotiation of speed and duplex. Instead, a switch port that has both speed and duplex configured disables autonegotiation. 


Which of the following is required when configuring port security with sticky learning?


A Setting the maximum number of allowed MAC addresses on the interface with the switchport port-security maximum interface subcommand
B Enabling port security with the switchport port-security interface subcommand
C Defining the specific allowed MAC addresses using the switchport port-security mac-address interface subcommand
D All the other answers list required commands
Explanation: Answer B is correct.

The setting for the maximum number of MAC addresses has a default of 1, so the switchport port-security maximum command does not have to be configured. With sticky learning, you do not need to predefine the specific MAC addresses either. However, you must enable port security, which requires the switchport port-security interface subcommand.

A Cisco Catalyst switch connects to what should be individual user PCs. Each port has the same port security configuration, configured as follows:

interface range gigabitethernet 0/1 - 24
switchport mode access
switchport port-security
switchport port-security mac-address sticky


Which of the following answers describe the result of the port security configuration created with these commands? (Choose two answers.)


A Prevents unknown devices with unknown MAC addresses from sending data through the switch ports
B If a user connects a switch to the cable, prevents multiple devices from sending data through the port
C Will allow any one device to connect to each port, and will save that device's MAC address into the startup-config
D Will allow any one device to connect to each port, but will not save that device's MAC address into the startup-config
Explanation: Answers B and D are correct.

First, about the sticky parameter… this command causes the switch to learn the source MAC, and to add it to a switchport port-security mac-address address interface subcommand. However, port security adds that command to the running-config file; the network engineer must also issue a copy running-config startup-config EXEC command to save that configuration.

About the other correct answer, users can connect a switch to the end of the cable, with multiple devices connected to that switch. That happens in real networks when users decide they need more ports at their desk. However, the default setting of switchport port-security maximum 1 means that a frame from the second unique source MAC address would cause a violation, and with the default violation action, to err-disable the port.

For the other incorrect answer, the configuration does not prevent unknown MAC addresses from accessing the port, because the configuration does not predefine any MAC address.

A switch's port Gi0/1 has been correctly enabled with port security. The configuration sets the violation mode to restrict. A frame that violates the port security policy enters the interface, followed by a frame that does not. Which of the following answers correctly describe what happens in this scenario? (Choose two answers.)


A The switch puts the interface into an err-disabled state when the first frame arrives.
B The switch generates syslog messages about the violating traffic for the first frame.
C The switch increments the violation counter for Gi0/1 by 1.
D The switch discards both the first and second frame.
Explanation: Answers B and C are correct.

First, about the two incorrect answers: When in restrict mode, the arrival of a frame that violates the port security policy does not cause the switch to put the interface into err-disabled state. It does cause the switch to discard any frames that violate the policy, but it leaves the interface up, and does not discard frames that do not violate the security policy, like the second frame that arrives.

Regarding the two correct answers, a port in port security restrict does cause the switch to issue log messages for a violating frame, send SNMP traps about that same event (if SNMP is configured), and to increment the counter of violating frames.

Some IOS commands store passwords as clear text, but you can then encrypt the passwords with the service password-encryption global command. By comparison, other commands store a computed hash of the password, rather than storing the password. Comparing the two options, which one answer is the most accurate about why one method is better than the other?


A Using hashes is preferred because encrypted IOS passwords can be easily decrypted.
B Using hashes is preferred because of the large CPU effort required for encryption.
C Using encryption is preferred because it provides stronger password protection.
D Using encryption is preferred because of the large CPU effort required for hashes.
Explanation: Answer A is correct.

The service password-encryption command encrypts passwords on a router or switch that would otherwise be shown in clear text. While a great idea in concept, the algorithm can be easily broken using websites found in the Internet. Cisco long ago provided replacements for commands that store passwords as clear text, instead using hashes - commands like enable secret and username secret. These commands are preferred in part because they avoid the issues of clear-text passwords and easily decrypted passwords.

A network engineer issues a show running-config command and sees only one line of output that mentions the enable secret command, as follows:

enable secret 5 $1$ZGMA$e8cmvkz4UjiJhVp7.maLE1


Which of the following is true about users of this router?


A A user must type $1$ZGMA$e8cmvkz4UjiJhVp7.maLE1 to reach enable mode.
B The router will hash the clear-text password that the user types to compare to the hashed password.
C A no service password-encryption configuration command would decrypt this password.
D The router will decrypt the password in the configuration to compare to the clear-text password typed by the user.
Explanation: Answer B is correct.

The enable secret command stores an MD5 hash of the password. It is unaffected by the service password-encryption command. The router does not unhash the value back to the clear-text password. Instead, when the user types her clear-text password, the router also hashes that password and compares that hashed value with the hashed value as listed in the configuration.

Imagine that you have configured the enable secret command, followed by the enable password command, from the console. You log out of the switch and log back in at the console. Which command defines the password that you had to enter to access privileged mode?


A enable password
B enable secret
C Neither
D The password command, if it's configured
Explanation: Answer B is correct.

If both commands are configured, IOS accepts only the password as configured in the enable secret command.

The following command was copied and pasted into configuration mode when a user was telnetted into a Cisco switch:

banner login this is the login banner


Which of the following is true about what occurs the next time a user logs in from the console?


A
No banner text is displayed.
B
The banner text "his is " is displayed.
C
The banner text "this is the login banner" is displayed.
D
The banner text "Login banner configured, no text defined" is displayed.
Explanation: Answer B is correct.

The first nonblank character after the banner login phrase is interpreted as the beginning delimiter character. In this case, it's the letter t. So, the second letter t - the first letter in "the" - is interpreted as the ending delimiter. The resulting login banner is the text between these two ts - namely, "his is ".

A single-line ACL has been added to a router configuration using the command ip access-list 1 permit 172.16.4.0 0.0.1.255. The configuration also includes the ip access-class 1 in command in VTY configuration mode. Which answer accurately describes how the router uses ACL 1?


A
Hosts in subnet 172.16.4.0/23 alone can telnet into the router.
B
CLI users cannot telnet from the router to hosts in subnet 172.16.4.0/23 alone.
C
Hosts in subnet 172.16.4.0/23 alone can log in but cannot reach enable mode of the router.
D
The router will only forward packets with source addresses in subnet 172.16.4.0/23.
Explanation: Answer A is correct.

The ip access-class 1 in command enables ACL 1 for processing inbound Telnet and SSH connections into that router, based on the source IP address of those incoming packets. It has no impact on Telnet or SSH attempts from the router to some other host. It has no impact on a user later reaching enable mode. It also has nothing to do with filtering packets that would otherwise be routed through the router. Note that the ACL matches all packets whose source IP address is in subnet 172.16.4.0/23, which includes the range of numbers from 172.16.4.0 to 172.16.5.255.
